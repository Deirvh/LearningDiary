## *The Problem*

After using basic statistics and plotting in a boxp lot using relevant r script, the statistics for male and female were visualised on incorrect sides of the boxplot, i.e. male statistics presenting over female statistics.

![Usageplot](Resources/images/Usageplot.png)

## *The Solution*

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE, message = FALSE, error= FALSE}
text(1, mean(MaleUsers$VALUE), paste("Mean:", round(mean(MaleUsers$VALUE), 2), "\nSD:", round(sd(MaleUsers$VALUE), 2)), pos = 2, col = "black")
text(2, mean(FemaleUsers$VALUE), paste("Mean:", round(mean(FemaleUsers$VALUE), 2), "\nSD:", round(sd(FemaleUsers$VALUE), 2)), pos = 4, col = "black")
```

Solving this problem took some trial and error, I had to adjust some factors in my code such as **pos** to alter the positioning of the statistics text in the boxplot @horton2015using.

## *The Problem*

I tried to create a linear regression model using two variables, but one of the categories "sex" would not work initially as it was not a numerical variable. I had to research regarding how a categorical variable could be included in the linear regression.

## *The Solution*

Creating levels for sex (0,1,2) allowed the different categories in the sex variable to be used in the regression model. This was done through R by encoding sex as a factor @zeng2023analytical.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE, message = FALSE, error= FALSE}

NonDeviceUserData$Sex <- factor(NonDeviceUserData$Sex)
```

## *The Problem*

I have been trying different rstudio packages related to visualising the data being used. I find once I export these graphs to save them for future use in assignments or practice, the graphs export in a manner that does not represent the data well, such as being spread out too far.

## *The Solution*

The lecture in week 4 demonstrates the use of quarto as a publication method of rstudio practices. Opening Rstudio as a qaurto document means all my work is saved in a html file. The graphs displayed in this file display better and are easier to go back and refer to.
